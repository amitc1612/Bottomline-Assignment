# Bottomline Assignment
* Author: Amit Cohen
  

### Jar
It is located in: `demo/target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

### Docker
The Spring Boot app is currently running on Docker, on my private EC2 instance, routed to port 9090.  
Access the app through the following link: [click me](http://matbuha.xyz:9090/hello).  
I will take it down once it has been checked and validated.

### Minikube
I don't have the sufficient memory on my PC to run a cluster ;)  
But I made the YAML files anyway.
